<p><h3>About</h3>
I am a PhD student passionate about public education and making music accessible through the museum. As a researcher, I use primary resources and archival materials such as musical scores, recordings, and correspondence related to American music to challenge our common perceptions of history, philosophy, religion, and art, while also complicating our conception of “American music.” In doing so, my research invites others to both question and appreciate our culture and heritage. I aspire to be a museum professional, where I will work to increase the diffusion of knowledge.</p>
